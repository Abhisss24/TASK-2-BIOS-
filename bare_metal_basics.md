5. BARE METAL BASICS
 Void setup(){
DDRB=32;
}
Void loop(){
PORTB=32;
Delay(1000);
PORTB=0;
Delay(1000);
}

This code is used to blink the led in bare metal . In this I used ARDUINO NANO. In this each point have different values.For example the point PB0 the value becomes 2 
raise to 0 ie; 1 the point PB5 becomes 32. In this bare metal the led is connected to the point PB5 thatâ€™s why in this code DDRB becomes 32 and get the output through portb =32 .


Connection: The point of PB5 is connected to the resistor and then connected to the led .The cathode is connected to the GRN of the Arduino.
